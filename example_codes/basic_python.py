#JDP Things in speech marks are 'strings' - a set of characters.
#JDP The code below will print the string "Hello, World!" to the console.
print("Hello, World!")

#JDP Words not in speech marks are assumed to be variables. 
#JDP We need to define a variable before we can use it. See below:
greeting = "Hey!"

#JDP We have just made a variable (greeting) represent a string (Hey!).
#JDP Now if we print the variable, we will produce the string.
print(greeting)

#JDP Variables can be anything - numbers, strings, arrays, objects..
pi = 3.14159
print(pi, greeting)
